# Common-Interview-Questions-for-Freshmen-and-Sophomores
This resource to help Freshmen and Sophomores quickly brush through the common interview problems and different solutions in python. We have included the runtime and space complexity. In case you run into any interesting intermediate and beginner level problems feel free to contribute 

Check out the website with the run time of python in built functions [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity)    

If you have an alternative solution to any of the above questions, kindly follow the ```Standards of contribution``` to add your work.

If there is a mistake in the analysis of the Space or Time Complexity, kindly contact [Kelvin Forson](<mailto:KelvinForson2023@u.northwestern.edu>) or [Linus Okoth](<mailto:LinusOkoth2023@u.northwestern.edu>)

Enjoy Learning and Goodluck!
